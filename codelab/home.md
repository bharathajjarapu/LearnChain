# Blockchain Codelab
You must be aware about Gmail, Whatsapp. But if the company shutsdown you may loose all your data, that is because all the data is owned by company centrally.  To fix this Decentralisation is the key. Blockchain is designed using Decentralisation concepts so that there is no central authority for commonly used data.  

Few popular examples include Maintaining LandPapers, Certificates issuing so that data can not be corrupted. 

In this codelab you will understand the fundamentals of Blockchain and how the applications are built.  Blockchain technology is still evolving and will have huge impact where data must be authentic & verifiable. 

## Prerequisites 
- Understand Basic Programming Languages like `Python` or `JavaScript`
- To be Added..


## Section1: Fundamentals of Blockchain
You will learn basics of Blockchain such as technologies, concepts & algorithms used.

## Section 5: Suggested Mini-Projects :

- [ ] **Digital Piggy Bank**  
      A virtual saving system where users can deposit, track, and withdraw their digital currency. Users can set goals and see their progress.

- [ ] **Simple Voting System**  
      A basic voting application where users can cast votes on given topics, view current results, and track the outcome. Admins can set up new voting polls and manage user participation.

- [ ] **Simple Verify System**  
      A basic verify application where users can verify docs on given chain, and detect the fake doc. Admins can set up new events and manage user participation.
